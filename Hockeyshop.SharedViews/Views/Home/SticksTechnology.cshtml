        <h2>The Evolution of Field Hockey Sticks</h2>
        <p>
            Field hockey sticks have come a long way from their humble beginnings. Originally crafted from wood, early sticks were durable but lacked versatility. Modern advancements in material science have introduced composite sticks made from carbon fiber, fiberglass, and aramid, revolutionizing the sport.

            Today’s composite sticks offer a perfect balance of power, control, and durability. They are lighter than wooden sticks and allow players to generate more power while maintaining precision during play.

        <h2>The Manufacturing Process</h2>
        <p>The creation of composite field hockey sticks involves several precise steps to ensure quality and performance:</p>

        <ul class="list-group mb-3">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1. Prepreg:</strong> Carbon fiber sheets are impregnated with resin to form strong, flexible layers.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>2. Lay-up:</strong> Sheets are layered in specific patterns to optimize strength and stiffness.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>3. Moulding:</strong> The stick is shaped under high pressure and heat to achieve the desired profile.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Finishing:</strong> The stick is sanded, painted, and coated for durability and aesthetics.</li>
        </ul>
